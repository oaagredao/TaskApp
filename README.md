# TaskApp
This project involves the creation of a task management application with user login, combining the power of Spring Boot on the server side and React on the client side to provide users with an efficient and secure way to manage their daily tasks.

#What it has
Currently, it includes the ability to create a user account, login, create tasks, and categorize them by color according to their importance.
The login implementation and validations have been done with JavaScript and React.
Additional validations, HTTP request handling, and database interaction are done using Spring Boot.

#Desired
A more user-friendly interaction for displaying tasks, improving the visual concepts on the main page, and implementing additional features related to task management.
Transitioning from logger-based confirmations to unit testing, improving backend security, and using an API for task expiration notifications.
